# Semantic HTML: Accessibility and SEO Project  

## ðŸ“– About the Project  
This project is designed to help learners build a strong foundation in **Semantic HTML**, with a focus on:  
- **Accessibility** (making web content usable for all, including people with disabilities).  
- **SEO optimization** (improving how search engines crawl and rank content).  
- **ARIA roles** (enhancing usability for assistive technologies).  

By the end of this project, learners will be able to structure and enhance a webpage that is both **visually organized** and **optimized for screen readers and search engines**.
